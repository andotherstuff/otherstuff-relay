### Changed
- Updated README.md with batch import information
- Updated deno.json with new tasks

### Performance
- Batch import achieves 10,000+ events/second with validation
- Can reach 100,000+ events/second with validation skipped
- Memory usage remains low (~50-200MB) regardless of file size
- Scales linearly with CPU cores for validation
